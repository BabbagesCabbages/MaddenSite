            Katy is now in her fourth year of managing the PreK program at 63 schools for Fresno Unified - one of the big perks of her job is she gets to visit and spend time in PreK classrooms. Kurt is in his twelfth year as CTO at Fresno Unified was excited to be involved in the launch of the district's new eSports league with 130 students participating in the first season, culminating in a district-wide competition at the Hoover High Event Center (his alma mater). He and Katy went to Chicago for the International Society of Technology Educators in June along with 10,000 other edugeeks. They also went to the Bruno Mars and Pink concerts. Kurt celebrated his 65th birthday this year and also became President of the Fresno State Alumni Board.

						 Kris and Rachel celebrated their second anniversary in October along with grandson Henry's first birthday. Mary is 8 years old and Charlotte's 7 and both are going to Malloch Elementary, where they cause almost as much ruckus as Kris did when he was that age. Kris is at Bullard High School assisting students with college and career choices and developed the logo for our new Fresno Unified eSports League (FUeL). He also continues to write and draw contributing regularly to different publications. Rachel is Assistant County Counsel for Tulare County and she travels daily to Visalia while listening to audiobooks during the commute. She took First Prize at the Big Fresno Fair for her significant knitting skills.

            Kasey also turned 33 this year and decided to travel more. She went to Costa Rica in February and across the world to Bali in August. In Costa Rica she discovered all those strange animals that are shown on facebook, like sloths, anteaters and weird-looking frogs and lizards. In Bali, she learned to surf and went to a world-famous restaurant that only serves dessert and had a 9-course meal ofâ€¦ desserts. She also met a number of interesting people in Bali but not as many interesting animals. This year Kasey went to work for her friend and boss, Luisa Medina at Central California Legal Services and also works behind the bar on Sundays at the Santa Fe Basque Restaurant. In those in-between times, she still draws amazing fierce women and hangs out with Tofu.
